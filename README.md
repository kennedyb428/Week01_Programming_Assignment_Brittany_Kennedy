This project, titled Vegetarian Nutrition for Weightlifting, is a C++ program designed to assist users in determining their suggested daily and per-meal macronutrient intake (protein, carbohydrates, and fats). 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic C++ programming concepts, including user input, variable and constant usage, mathematical calculations, and formatted output.
To demonstrate those skills, this program uses input from the user to calculate totals based on established macronutrient distribution percentages for individuals engaged in weightlifting while following a vegetarian diet.

So, the overall functionality of the program is as follows:
  1) Prompt the user to enter relevant information (such as body weight or calorie target).
  2) Calculate recommended daily macronutrient amounts based on preset percentages.
  3) Divide the total macronutrients into per-meal portions.
  4) Display all results neatly formatted to the user.
